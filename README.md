# sort_players

The goal of this program is to sort players using the score and the time. So, player with the highest score and the least time goes 1st, player with the least score and most time goes last. 
Say we are comparing between two players, if player_x has a grater score than player_y, then player_y goes below player_x, however if they are equal in score, then we compare in finish time, where the player with least time taken is above the player with maximum time taken.

Inputs are : 

* n : the number of players 
* next n lines : a string containing the result of the players splitted by space: the player's name, his score and the time taken.
